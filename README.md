# Japanese React Application

## Welcome ✌️

Hello there ! Welcome to my project : Japanese React Application.

## Objectives 🏹

Thanks to this project, I really hope :

## Resume 🗒️

This project will contain my first Japanese Web/Mobile Application. Designed to be simple and accessible, it works entirely in the frontend and backend without database (SQL).

## Deployment 🚀

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/maximilien-bruyere/japanese-react-app.git`.
2. Open the cloned folder in your terminal.
3. Run the command `npm install` to install all dependencies.
4. Use the command `npm start` to start both the frontend and backend.
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000/`.

## Features (planned) 🚧

- [x] 📖 Integrated dictionaries: Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji and vocabulary as JSON files, directly accessible within the application.
- [ ] ⚡ 100% standalone application: no server required, everything runs locally via the browser.
- [ ] 🎨 Responsive interface: Developed with React, offering fluid, intuitive navigation.
- [ ] 🔍 Quick search: Instant access to words and characters thanks to a dynamic filtering system.
