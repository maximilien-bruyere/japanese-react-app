# Japanese React Application

## Welcome ✌️

Hello there ! Welcome to my project : Japanese React Application.

## Objectives 🏹

Thanks to this project, I really hope :

[x] Learning Japanese efficiently
[x] Learning the fundamental concepts of React
[x] Using Git and Github correctly
[x] Learning how to develop a mobile and web application with React
[x] Discovering new NPM packages and how to use them

## Resume 🗒️

This project will contain my first Japanese Web/Mobile Application. Designed to be simple and accessible, it works entirely in the frontend, with no need for a backend or database.

## Features (planned) 🚧

- 📖 Integrated dictionaries: Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji and vocabulary as JSON files, directly accessible within the application.
- ⚡ 100% standalone application: no server required, everything runs locally via the browser.
- 🎨 Responsive interface: Developed with React, offering fluid, intuitive navigation.
- 🔍 Quick search: Instant access to words and characters thanks to a dynamic filtering system.
